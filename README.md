Nameper.com is a simplistic tool to help people in the quest for the perfect name. Whether that name be for a baby, pet, friend or on-line handle, nameper.com is the place to start, when you don't know where to start. 
Nameper.com simply fetches you random names. You can select which gender you are querying for or just choose both and roll the dice. You can receive names on demand or have the site fetch you a name in a given interval or time.
So you can site back, kick your feet up and let the names roll by. 

Nameper.com started out as my quest for a project with a small enough scope that I could manage the whole thing myself in my spare time outside of work. Initially the project was just a sandbox for me to broaden my knowledge in the web development landscape, to test out frontend frameworks and solidify my knowledge/understanding of JavaScript. When the brunt of the engineering was done, I used this project as another opportunity to expand my skills and took on the task of hosting the site on a virtual private server and handling all the system administration myself. 

Nameper.com is far from finished though and I would love to hear any feedback from anyone. Like all engineering projects, this too will be iterative and updated as I (and hopefully others) think of new and interesting features, so stayed tuned and drop me a line if you'd like.
